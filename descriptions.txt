Label Text: Hailing originally from central Asia, the Mughal dynasty dominated the political landscape of the Indian subcontinent for three centuries, from the early sixteenth until the middle of the nineteenth century. This Muslim family claimed to be semidivine, as indicated by this portrait of a Mughal prince with a golden halo. The figure’s effortless command of the rearing stallion further underscores his supernatural nature, while the elaborate costume, jewelry, and other adornments—even the horse has been decorated with a rich, salmon-hued henna dye—convey his royal status. Distinctive features such as the full beard, large ear, and sideburn curl suggest that this is a depiction of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb’s son Bahadur Shah (d. 1712), who also appears in a painting on display nearby. Bahadur Shah would ascend to the throne in 1707, at the age of sixty-three. In this magisterial portrait, which was probably painted only a few years earlier, he is portrayed as a virile young man.- Yael Rice, 2015

Label Text: Male artists were seldom permitted visual access to female members of India’s royal courts. For this reason, representations of women tend to be fairly generic, while portraits of princes, emperors, and male courtiers are much more individuated. In typical fashion, the woman in this painting is portrayed as an anonymous, idealized beauty, though her golden halo and elaborate jewelry hint at her royal status. The format of the composition also draws from a standard imperial image type developed at the Mughal court in the early seventeenth century. Known as jharokha (balcony) portraits, these paintings show the emperors giving public audience from a palace window or balcony. Where contemporary jharokha paintings depict Muhammad Shah (r. 1719–1748) holding the mouthpiece of a hookah, the woman here cradles a vase of flowers. Colorful blossoms abound on the textiles and building and in the garden surrounding her.-Yael Rice, 2015

Label Text: The story of Layla and Qays’s unrequited love is an allegory for the mystic’s desire for union with God. The star-crossed sweethearts meet as youths, but being from rival clans they are forbidden from marrying. As a result of their forced separation, Qays goes crazy, retreats into the desert, and becomes known as Majnun (“mad one”). This painting shows the emaciated, unkempt Majnun seated under a large tree. Sympathetic animals gather in pairs around him, while a crowd of concerned visitors approaches from the left. Majnun, meanwhile, appears otherwise preoccupied, no doubt with thoughts of his beloved.The Persian poet Nizami (d. 1209) expanded upon and popularized this pre-Islamic Arabian tale when he incorporated it into his celebrated Khamsa (Quintet). Illustrations of the romance typically accompany manuscript copies of this and related texts, but the Mead painting seems to have been made as a stand-alone work, perhaps for inclusion in an album.

Label Text: Like many famous romances, the quasi-historical tale of Baz Bahadur, the Muslim ruler of Malwa, and the Hindu singer Rupmati ends in tragedy. The two met and fell in love while Baz Bahadur was hunting outside his capital of Mandu, in central India. Not long after, the Mughal emperor Akbar (r. 1556–1605) invaded Malwa, and the lovers became separated. While Baz Bahadur was soliciting help from neighboring allies, Rupmati poisoned herself to avoid capture by the enemy army. Works like this one, which shows the sultan and his wife at the hunt, became especially popular at India’s royal courts during the eighteenth century. Because the Mead painting is largely unfinished, the artist’s hand—including his delicate underdrawing and masterful shading—is still visible. His alterations and erasures are also evident. In some places, for example, he used a thin layer of white paint to mask his errors.- Yael Rice, 2015

Label Text: The great Hindu god, Shiva, sits with his wife, Parvati, and his bull vahana (mount), Nandi, before a cave that holds a trident and crescent moon, two of the god’s attributes. The mountainous landscape recalls the holy family’s Himalayan abode atop Mount Kailash, but it may also reference the sacred Amaranth Cave, in Jammu and Kashmir, where Shiva is said to have revealed to Parvati the secrets of life and the universe. An anonymous artist called the “Stipple Master”—because of his distinctive use of dots and short strokes—probably painted this work while serving at the court of Amar Singh II (r. 1698–1710) in Udaipur, Rajasthan. Since the Stipple Master is best known for his intimate portraits of Amar Singh, this painting may also be a representation of him, though depicted here in the guise of Shiva. Hindu and Muslim rulers often claimed to enjoy close proximity to divinity.- Yael Rice, 2015

Label Text: Krishna, one of the ten avatars (manifestations) of the Hindu god Vishnu, was raised by humble foster parents in a cow-herding village near the forest of Vrindavan. There he spent much of his youth enchanting the gopis (female cowherds) with the celestial sounds of his flute playing. They all pined for the Krishna, but it was Radha who would become his favorite. She and the blue-skinned deity are the centerpiece of this remarkable painting created in or near Kangra, home to the court of Raja Sansar Chand (r. 1775–1823) and a renowned family of painters. It shows the colorful celebration of the springtime festival Holi. Many of the revelers spray each other with tinted water, while others dance and play music. Krishna, wearing his characteristic yellow dhoti (unstitched cloth) and peacock-feather crown, has eyes only for Radha, however. Their passionate, mutual devotion is a symbol of the union of the human and the divine.- Yael Rice, 2015

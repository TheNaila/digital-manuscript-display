### Abstract

Manuscripts are hard to display because of the space required, because of this, many pieces in Amherst College's Mead Museum collections are unseen. Some of those works of art like the Indian manuscripts that inspired this project are too small and delicate to be displayed through traditional means for the public. With the help of this software, we now have a way to display images of the art via projection making the collections more accessible. 

The collection used for this demo is the *"Mughal Period"* collection gifted by Alban G. Widgery. It features 36 art pieces of an Indian Raga Manuscript.
